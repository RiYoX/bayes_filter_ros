Bayes++, the Bayesian Filtering Library ported to ROS

Bayes++ is an open source library of C++ classes. These classes represent and implement a wide variety of numerical algorithms for Bayesian Filtering of discrete systems. The classes provide tested and consistent numerical methods and the class hierarchy explicitly represents the variety of filtering algorithms and system model types
